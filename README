The autovet code is located in this directory. 

What is in all of the directories in this folder? 

/hveto_autovet is the run directory I'm currently using for hveto VET runs
/UPVh_autovet is the run directory I'm currently using for UPVh VET runs

/misc has a bunch of random code that I need to sort through

/development has code that I used to develop and test pieces of autovet.py
